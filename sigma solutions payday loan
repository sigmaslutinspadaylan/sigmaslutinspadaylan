Some employers are willing to provide cash via an advance on your paycheck. The limit for this kind of borrowing typically is $1,000. It’s vital to keep in mind that the money you receive in the advance will be deducted from your next paycheck.

The good news about that is you can receive cash in a hurry, if you need it.  The bad thing is the next paycheck will be reduced, so it’s important to budget accordingly. Keep in mind that the employer may provide the advance on a debit card and not all institutions accept debit card payments of this kind.
